# Connect4 Game Project

Welcome to the Connect4 Game project! This project includes two files - `connect4.py` and `Connect4GUI.py` - providing both a simple terminal-based version and a graphical user interface (GUI) version of the classic Connect Four game.

## connect4.py

### Description
`connect4.py` is a simple implementation of Connect Four in the terminal. The game board is represented as a 6x7 matrix, where Player 1 is represented by the token '1', and Player 2 is represented by the token '2'. Players take turns to drop their tokens into columns, aiming to connect four of their tokens either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

### How to Play
1. Run the script: `python connect4.py`
2. Enter the column number where you want to drop your token.
3. Alternate turns between Player 1 and Player 2.
4. The first player to connect four tokens in a row wins!

## Connect4GUI.py

### Description
`Connect4GUI.py` is a graphical version of Connect Four implemented using the pygame library. This version features a visual dialog box where Player 1 plays with Red Tokens, and Player 2 plays with Yellow Tokens. The GUI enhances the gaming experience with a more interactive and visually appealing interface.

### How to Play
1. Run the script: `python Connect4GUI.py`
2. Click on the column where you want to drop your token.
3. Players take turns clicking, and the game continues until there's a winner or a draw.
4. Enjoy the graphical representation of the classic Connect Four game.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (install using `pip install pygame`)

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance the game or add new features. Happy gaming!
